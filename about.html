        <h2>About Bullpen Tracker</h2>

        <p>
            <i class="bpt-emph">Bullpen Tracker</i> was originally made as a utility
            for my college baseball team. However it quickly became a project that I wanted to release to the public.
            I am hoping to have the iOS app released to the app store and the website fully functional by
            the end of the calendar year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app and website were both made from the ground up by Sam Hollenbach, with some additional help from
            Andy Hayes. Please contact me at <a href="mailto:samhollenbach@gmail.com">samhollenbach@gmail.com</a> if you have
            questions, ideas, inquiries or want to learn more!
